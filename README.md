Fonts are collected from different sources. Fonts are hard work of the creators. Respect their work.

I have tested the script only from Debian Based Distributions Like Debian itself, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Kali, Netrunner etc. I        hope it will also work on RPM based Distributions like Fedora, OpenSuse, Mandriva, CentOS etc. It should also work with others  like Archlinux.
